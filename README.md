EF Relationship

Mastering Relationships in EF Core – 1:1, 1:N & N:N

✅ One-to-One (1:1)
📌 Example: A User has one Profile, and each Profile belongs to one User.
 ✔️ Use navigation properties on both sides
 ✔️ EF Core creates a foreign key in one table

✅ One-to-Many (1:N)
📌 Example: A Blog can have many Posts, but each Post belongs to one Blog.
 ✔️ Add a collection property (e.g., Posts in Blog)
 ✔️ Add a navigation property (e.g., Blog in Post)

✅ Many-to-Many (N:N)
📌 Example: A Student can enroll in many Courses, and each Course can have many Students.
 ✔️ EF Core 5+ supports skip navigations (no manual join entity needed)
 ✔️ EF Core creates the linking table automatically under the hood

✨ Why Relationships Matter
✔️ Keep data structured & consistent
 ✔️ Enable powerful & flexible LINQ queries
 ✔️ Represent real-world scenarios naturally
